2025 has begun. It started on a bit of a slow note as I entered it sick. It was a cold or flu that knocked me down for a few days as much as I tried to avoid being outside in public in the lead up to the holidays. It wasn't COVID but I still lost my sense of taste and smell for a few days and that was disorienting. 

In this new year, I do hope to write more here. I'm hoping to use my site as a means to not just post blog posts but syndicate elsewhere. I have [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app) linked up to do that for these posts and for my [Notes](/notes) section separately so they don't gum each others' feeds up. 

I set up Decap CMS mostly to be able to post Notes. I anticipate still writing/posting blog posts as I previously had.

Anyway, I hope you all had a great holiday so far! Stay healthy. 2025 (and the next four years) are going to be ... something ... in the US (future posts will talk about this I'm sure).
