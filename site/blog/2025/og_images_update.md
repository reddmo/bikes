This is a post that should hopefully prove I updated the OG image. I wanted to clean it up a bit because it was **not** looking great or aligned. I also removed the dashed lines because I didn't like them. 

This should look cleaner and more aesthetically aligned with the site. Pay no attention to this post otherwise.
