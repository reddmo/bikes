Again, here we are. I spent some time redesigning the site. As I get more comfortable with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and [Eleventy Excellent 2.0](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent), it makes it easy to make changes.

For me, that's a blessing and a curse. I tinker to the point of **revamping** the design in a night because I, well, had the time? I guess?

A few things I tried to do was revert back to using the ```colors.json``` file properly. Previously I added the colors directly to the ```variables.css``` but, as some of you reading this may know, just made changing colors tedious. 

Additionally, after [finally getting webmentions working](/blog/webmentions-and-11ty) it just seemed like a celebration to take another look under the hood and make some adjustments. [Zach Leatherman's](https://zachleat.com/@zachleat) Eleventy and [Lene's](https://front-end.social/@lene) Eleventy-Excellent just make making changes **fun**. I'm enjoying designing a website again maybe for the first time since geocities and angelfire?

So, as I work towards adding more actual posts, please enjoy some of these as well:

And some others that, in my next project, will be included in a blogroll.

Anyway, happy reading, happy blogging.
