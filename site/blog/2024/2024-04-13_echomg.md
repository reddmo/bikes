Well, it was time to try something new. I had been following the development of [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app/) by [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/about/) because I had wanted a way to, essentially, autopost these posts to Mastodon, BlueSky, etc. 

It was released yesterday and in the process of reading more into it I also started looking at [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol) and the variety of things you can do, including a Mastodon server at [social.lol](https://social.lol) (NOTE: you must be a subscriber to omg.lol to have an account at social.lol). Something struck a chord with it all. It was an amount of whimsy and technical aspects I was looking for.

And now with EchoFeed revved up, I can post to here to my site, have it post to my Mastodon (and BlueSky) automatically, and not have to worry about it (I think -- this is the first post I'm writing since turning the key, so I may have to update this if I messed something up along the way). 

I'll probably write more on both omg.lol and EchoFeed in the coming days as I explore them more but this post was really to note a bit of that but, really, to test EchoFeed. 

This is an update of an earlier post with some editing and a change of domain.
