I know the obvious post today would be something about Star Wars but I wasn't intentionally diverging from that.

I was reading some other posts, blogs and Mastodon, and music was weaving throughout particularly related to the early years of when music started to mean something to me.

I remember the earliest of listening to The Highwaymen with my dad or certain songs and albums and we drove down I-95 to Jekyll Island. Those songs and memories will always mean something.

Entering into my punk/post-punk/hardcore/emo/etc. phase, I'll remember hearing Pedro the Lion for the first time. The song was, "Almost There." It was a beautiful sonic mix of everything at the time. I was younger then, of course. But it was raw, simple, elegant, grating, unbalanced.

That song - and band - started a joke amongst my friends about the type of music I listened to. I found bands and songs that were slow in tempo - counterintuitive to our mainstays of Snapcase, Hot Water Music, Agnostic Front, and others. Like, "LoveLetterTypewriter," by Mineral (and the whole album it's from). I'd recommend songs to challenge them. I genuinely liked them but it was, I thought, to broaden their horizons. 

But I love the beauty of music in all its forms.

Give "Whole," by Pedro the Lion a listen and the rest of the albums but, especially, "It's Hard to Find a Friend." But don't fail and don't half-ass this task.

Do or do not. There is no try.
