If you follow tech news, you're probably already aware that new iPads were announced today with bigger and better chips, thinner forms, and higher prices.

One thing I've not been able to wrap my head around are the repetitive complaints of the iPad not being able to compete with MacBooks or iMacs. Should it? 

I know people want that to be the case but there's a reason Apple makes a range of products for a reason: to meet a variety of different computing needs. I understand wanting a touchscreen MacBook or iMac, which would meet some needs. I don't think that's a reason to write off or expect more from the iPad, which I think in the long run is a general consumer product. Most people I know with iPads use them to FaceTime (or other video calls) or browse social media but on a bigger screen in lieu of wanting to pull out a laptop or get on a desktop.

Anyway, I know tech media needs to get its views but sometimes it seems like products get beat up for the sake of it (but, also, who needs a table this thin?!).
