Well, here we are. What's old is new again.

After some time spent away, I've moved my site back to [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) and just went right ahead and have it feeding on a schedule to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

I know why I moved in the first place and it was mostly to keep my brain occupied with a new task but 11ty is just ... so fun. As a matter of fact, with this move back I've written my first shortcode. It's most definitely based on the work of others and guidance from the loads of great posts and info out there written on 11ty. From those, I learned how to write the shortcode I needed. It's in use in a small way on the Blog list for the lucide icons with the assist of [@grimlink/eleventy-plugin-lucide-icons](https://github.com/GrimLink/eleventy-plugin-lucide-icons?tab=readme-ov-file) and [Sebin's Blog post](https://blog.sebin-nyshkim.net/posts/building-a-blog-with-eleventy-blind-any/).

That said, I did add pagination to the [Blog](/blog) page and reformatted that page a bit.

Anyway, a lot of this so far was to keep my mind off the election results. I do have some other posts in the hopper, on that topic specifically, but also on some of my riding along with other plans for the site, including adding a photos page. That'll take some time and keep my busy on my downtime when my brain needs to be distracted.
