I've been debating with myself about whether I was going to (try to) participate in WeblogPoMo2024. Did I need another commitment or deadline? Did I have anything to say everyday?

The short answer: I don't know.

But I'm doing it anyway. I'm going to try a daily post, long or short, text or graphic, but attempt all the same. I don't think it'll be one consistent topic.

Today's brief post is this intro and a brief foray into what I'm currently working on, which is a massive software upgrade for our County. We are overhauling our entire accounting and payroll systems. 

It's a big move and modernization with a lot of processes changing as a result. Some of the changes are needed for efficiency; some are a requirement of the software. We have a mix of employee tenures' involved in the project and that shows on the change management side. (I may address that at some point in the future, as change management has been a constant of my career.)

We've been in training and configuration last and this week (today is the last day) and we are precisely two months from our go live date. Suffice to say the next few weeks are going to be ... hectic.
