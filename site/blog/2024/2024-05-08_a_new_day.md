Today is a nice weather day here which is, well, nice. I'm a big fan of open windows -- I hate humid heat but almost despise AC more because I like to hear, see, and feel the Outside.

Anyway, this is a post to fulfill today's requirement. But I hope wherever you are it is your version of nice today. I know the world is off its axis but find your individual peace for a moment if you can.

Hereâ€™s a listen for today: [How to Start a Fire](https://open.spotify.com/track/1putoqCWxyGdbZxSxnUrsk?si=15e728515dbf4309) by Further Seems Forever.
