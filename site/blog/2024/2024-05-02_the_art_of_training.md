I don't think training is going to be my theme for the rest of the month, but it is for the first two days because the start of WeblogPoMo 2024 coincided with the last two days (for now) of training.

It has been intense but I think we've structured what we had so far well. We scheduled the right people for this phase and I think we had the right buy-in. There are certainly a group of skeptical folks but I think even they are starting (hopefully) to turn the corner.

We'll have end user training in the beginning of next month prior to go live. My to-do list for this part had tripled in size since training started last week but I've already worked through part of that. The rest over the next few days.

I am genuinely very excited about the implementation and while I know there will be some end user resistance and other resistance due to the nature of my position, I believe it's going to benefit everyone in the long run. Plus, I really like tech/software/security enhancements (except AI, but maybe that'll be another blog this month), so it's a big convergence of a lot of interests.

Anyway, go listen to St. Vincent's new album, All Born Screaming.
