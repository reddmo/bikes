I went on my longest one-way ride yesterday to date with this bike. I've ridden longer before but over generally flatter terrain. This was the first push for the bike on a some different terrain but also a variety of inclines, traffic, and nature. It was a peaceful ride in pleasant weather. At the end, I was refreshed. It was just over 10 miles and in the image below, edited to protect where I went, you can again see an easter egg of where my directions did not catch up to where I actually was.

Overall, would do again.
