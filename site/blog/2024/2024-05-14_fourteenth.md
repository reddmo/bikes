On day 14, I find myself struggling to write posts. It's not that I don't have ideas -- I do. Or, more accurately, did. 

They pop into my head at an odd time of day and I think, "That's what I'll write about!" But I don't write it down. And then I forget later. And then it's 9:30PM and I have a post to write to stay on track but not an idea left.

So, here we are. I do still enjoy WeblogPoMo ... challenge? Concept? It does keep me thinking about writing something and now, about halfway through, maybe its taught me to write down an idea or two when I have one. 

C'est la vie.
