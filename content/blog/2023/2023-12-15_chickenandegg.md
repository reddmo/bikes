![Conversation between a chicken and an egg on a sidewalk on the side of the road. Across the street there is another sidewalk, some flowers, and trees. The egg asks the chicken, "Did they figure out which of us came first?" The chicken responds, "I don't know but I'm going to cross and think about it."](/assets/images/chicken.png)

I was re-designing the site and thought I'd add some bad art to prove the point.
