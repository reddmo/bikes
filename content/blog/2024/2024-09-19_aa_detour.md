Today was a bit more of the same except I had a side quest. At lunch today, I went on a 10.33mi trip to deliver Harris/Walz yard signs to someone during my lunch break. It was the longest ride since getting my bike and really put it (and me) through our paces. There was plenty of changing elevation, inclines, and busier roads than normal to put a little confidence in my goal of using the bike as a primary means of travel. You can see the path below. Part of this post was also seeing how a non-square image would render because of the route for the start of the trip.

A little easter egg. See if you can find in the return trip where I made a wrong turn.

Overall, it was a really great ride. It was a beautiful day. I wasn't necessarily prepared for the number of bugs on me afterwards but I guess that's one of the trade-offs.

I do still notice my "steps" for the day are down, but I'm not sure that matters with the mileage I'm getting in on the rides.
