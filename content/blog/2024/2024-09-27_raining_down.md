Quick post today but it was raining on the way home and the bike handled really well, including braking on very steep hills. I was really pleased with the braking system and traction. I didn't feel any skidding or sliding. The fenders were also protective.

All in all, it was a good test and commute; I'm really more happy each day I ride (both with the bike and literally mood-wise).
