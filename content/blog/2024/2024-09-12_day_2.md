Day 2 is under the belt and I realized prior to the commute to work that my seat and handlebars weren't quite at comfortable positions. I adjusted them and today's commute was far more comfortable. But also, as luck had it, my new more comfortable seat also showed up this afternoon so that should add to the comfortability of the rides.

Also, I'm not sure yet if I will do daily or weekly updates. Daily may be too much at least for ride data. I'm still figuring out this focused-blog-thing.
