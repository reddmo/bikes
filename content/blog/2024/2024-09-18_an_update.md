I've been keeping the same commute route using [bikemap](https://bikemap.net) and using Workouts on my Apple Watch on each trip. So today I'm using the images from the Apple Fitness app in lieu of the bikemap ones as a test. I like that they don't have quite some of the other information as the ones from bikemap. I still like bikemap and will have a better review of that after some more usage.

Today, though, was the first day of my bike commuting that was calling for inclement weather. I planned and prepped my trip around the weather (rain). Even after arriving at work, which lacks a bike rack, I opted to bring my bike to my office to keep it out of the rain. I still don't have rain gear yet so the planning was around when the rain was forecasted to start and end.

And then ... nothing. It didn't rain. Not once. But at least I was prepared.

But in the past few days I've done some proper modifications. Most were minor but for comfortability of the ride including proper tire pressure adjustments. Getting back into some biking has been fun and it does seem to helping my mood as well.
