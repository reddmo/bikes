Yesterday's post was just past midnight into Saturday that it's almost two days since I posted but haven't yet missed a single day between posts. Time is a flat circle.

Today's post is both late and brief. I was hit with one of the worst headaches I've had in a long time yesterday. The kind that required me to shield my eyes from almost any form of light for a few hours. Overall it lasted about 10 hours, though the worst was constrained to about four hours of it. 

So why post about it? I think to remind me 1) to post but 2) to remind me (and maybe all of us?) that things can get in the way of our posts during this month. Don't let posting become a new anxiety. On the flip side, wanting to post to continue the streak pushed me to give this brief update and motivation.
