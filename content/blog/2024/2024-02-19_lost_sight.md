I’ve been thinking a lot about this site and this blog. First, I think I may have bloated some of the files and will be reviewing some of those over the next whatever: days, weeks. But that said, one of the things I realized as I continued to tinker with it was that I lost sight of the blog itself. 

I am very much aware now that I was constantly meddling with the site design to the detriment of not writing any posts. My mind keeps bouncing across a number of different topics at the moment (and past several days) but instead of taking time to reflect on any one of them I … edited the shadow on the buttons on the site and spent more time trying to figure out why the buttons in the menus resize slightly when active (again, I may’ve added a little too much bloat into the CSS).

So, I am going to try and at least balance that time. I can’t promise I’m not going to tinker more (I mean maybe you want to know how long it’d take to read this post before delving in?!). A site that’s easy to edit and manipulate **IS GREAT**. 

Until it’s not. Until it starts getting in the way of actually writing some stuff down. And then it becomes another source of anxiety instead of a relief. 

So onwards and upwards. Maybe there’ll be another new post sooner than a new feature.
