I was trying to think of what to post today. I didn't have a theme for WeblogPoMo and probably won't establish one. I think attempting to post every day in May is enough without constraining it to a topic (FOR ME!).

So today, I'll leave you with a brief list of what's exciting me today:

- [UK Election Results](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/uk-politics-68609729?src_origin=BBCS_BBC)
- The Weekend is Here
- [BBEdit 15](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/), where I do all of this site's editing

What's not exciting me today:

- Pollen
- It's going to rain all weekend
- Did I say pollen?

I know there's a lot going on in the world but try and enjoy something small this weekend. I am.

I keep listening to [This Could be Texas](https://open.spotify.com/album/4gd3XcQ7dR37m8GimBfiYT?si=yDICA7-7QrSCyw_3dajrrA) by English Teacher (Spotify link). It's a good album. Give it a spin this weekend.

To everyone else participating in WeblogPoMo, good luck, God speed, and I love what you're doing.
