Day 1 of commuting to work on the e-bike is under the belt. I'm still figuring out how to push the [Exist.io](https://exist.io) API automatically into the posts. I'm also considering whether I want to or not. What I have decided at the moment is below: I'm calling the API and getting a JSON output and presenting here as code. I think it fits with the overall vibe of the site.

Learning lessons from today:
- Start the Workout on my Apple Watch before I take off. I usually let it prompt me after I start a walk or, now, bike ride but today it didn't capture half of the commute home.
- Music may or may not be an option. This may be the opportunity for more audiobooks and/or podcasts. Today, however, I didn't do either. I wanted to gauge the ride and am still debating the safety. There are speakers that can be mounted to bikes but that seems a bit overboard.
- Traffic was generally respectful on my route but I will probably test some other routes for traffic volume, etc.
- Blog-wise, I also fixed (I think) my images for proper sizing.
