This what supposed to be yesterday's post -- and still is but also today's -- but I broke something in the redesign with images in posts and they're messing with the rss feed.

It's probably a simple fix and one that I'll (hopefully) get to this evening. But for now, here's a song for the day.

Here’s a listen for yesterday: [Kathy's Song](https://open.spotify.com/track/4Acofe9hICRvyBTP5hFNk0?si=37ff4f42814a4244) by Simon & Garfunkel.

Here’s a listen for today: [Heads Gonna Roll](https://open.spotify.com/track/3JEQn0WheNcipQmxNxrxII?si=e06b6b2bf5ba4103) by Jenny Lewis.
