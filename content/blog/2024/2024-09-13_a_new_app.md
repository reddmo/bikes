Today's commute was a little different. After some days of researching apps, I signed up for [bikemap](https://bikemap.net) last night. The app will show routes for biking and you can select by type of route you want or type of bike you're using. The premium subscription also provides navigation as well as some other advanced features including sharing of routes, etc.

I've included a few images you can share in this post for my commute today. I won't be sharing that every day because, well, it's the same. So far, though, I do like the features of the service but your (*ahem*) mileage may vary. The app also integrates with Apple Health, which works nicely for me. It can collect and contribute to Workout data and seems to have a pretty good Privacy policy to boot.

What I did like about the routes today that bikemap put together was they were not routes I would have thought of on my own. Or at least I don't think I would've since, well, I hadn't yet. The traffic seemed lighter on both but there were changing inclines and both were a little bit longer than the past two days, which is something I'm looking for. Commuting by bike for me now is a combination of health, environmental, and just enjoyment factors.

The updated bike seat definitely made a difference today but I think I need a little adjustment on it yet. I am pretty happy with the bike selection so far, though well aware that it's only day three. I'll hold off on a full scale review for some time yet.

I scrapped some of the data from the Exist.io output today as a test. The data below is specific to the bike whereas past days included all activity. Again, trying to hone and focus the information and data provided.
