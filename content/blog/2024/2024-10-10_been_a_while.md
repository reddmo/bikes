It's been a while!

Some things have been busy on the home front and we spent a week in Austin, which we usually do this time of year for the ACL Festival.

This year there weren't too many acts that I **had** to see but enough that made going worth it, including Leon Bridges (phenomenal!), Blink-182 (who I probably haven't seen since my days of attending Warped Tour ...), Chris Stapleton, though I missed him because he was playing opposite Blink-182, and Chappel Roan.

There were quite a few other artists who I was not familiar with prior to going but came away a fan. Myles Smith, Teddy Swims, Misterwives, Jungle, and Eggy to name a few. Though, truth be told, I have to give them all another spin to make sure. Benson Boone also puts on a hell of a show.

It was refreshing to be away and not look at some other stuff happening in life, mostly work adjacent things.

And for those of you who follow me on my other blog, I'll be posting there again, too, in the next day or so. Obviously being away I wasn't commuting on bike all that much.
