# About

I am a person that writes stuff.

I live in Central PA with my wife, our cats, and a bearded dragon. I say I enjoy reading but really my English degree sapped some of that out of me so I read through books slower these days. 

I play several musical instruments and even a few of them well. I like to get very involved in new technologies enough to make me dangerous and break a lot things. 

I am politically involved and progressive.
